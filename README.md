This repo is a subset of all the project I have been working on over the past few years. As a French engineering student with great interest in trading, I have gathered here a lot of project linked more or less closely to the whole environment of trading (systematic trading strategies, alpha creation, trading competition, computer science competition, ...) If there is anything you find interesting in this repo, I would be more than happy to exchange about it : cam42demeure@gmail.com
