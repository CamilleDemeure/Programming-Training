This project aims to build a momentum strategy inspired from the paper Beat the Market An Effective Intraday Momentum Strategy for S&P500 ETF (SPY). I extended the paper to SP500 and Nasdaq futures. I also extended the trading logic to improve the performance of the model. I achieved for both index a Sharpe Ratio above 1 for a strategy with really high capacity. This strategy is very likely decorrelated from the underlyign asset and is thus a great strategy to introduce in an existing basket. I assembled in the repo all my codes. I apologize for the lack of organization in my code. I would be glad to communicate and talk about my results (cam42demeure@gmail.com)
